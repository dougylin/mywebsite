                SOX Audits are internal controls tied to financial statements.  
                A lot of accounting majors end up here.  
                You do not want to touch any work related to financial statements, ever.  
                It’s tied to filing deadlines, which is why you hear about the hours being bad in FSO.  
                EY (for now) has FSO and Advisory/Consulting service lines, clearly delineated for regulatory independence reasons.  
                Every recruiting cycle, B4 partners seem to play around with the names and reorganizations, so keep track of the actual job functions and not the titles as the field continues to evolve.  
                I've heard colleagues get burned choosing "Risk XYZ" and end up doing assurance-styled work.  
                But I wouldn’t worry too much about being placed in SOX or financial statement audits because it’s unlikely that you were recruited for this given your DS background.

                The holy grail is to be on the advisory side doing risk work, which I’m guessing you’ll be on.  
                Margins and work-life balance on these types of projects tend to be better.  
                If you’re feeling investigative, every project has an engagement letter sent to the client that lists the going rates each associate to MD bills to the clients.  
                You’ll see that advisory can always charge their clients more than assurance.  
                I worked at Armanino, so within T20 public accounting firms doing this type of work, I managed to not work more than 4 hours a day (as an intern + got a return offer).  
                I believe you’ll have a regular 9-5 at EY based on what I’ve heard—if you can handle yourself well in a very corporate environment.  
                Normally, you work on SOC+ reports, which are internal controls but with an enterprise governance risk and compliance (GRC) flavor.  
                Very rarely have I heard of anyone doing ISO framework work.

                Life is chill with the right clients, which is largely determined by your manager.  
                However, if you’re proactive, you can ask to be staffed on other managers’ projects that align most with your interests.  
                A lot of people will have CISA, CIA, CISM, etc., and maybe a CISSP for super-technical cyber audits.  
                Always scout out future engagements if you hate your current clients.  
                I always tell people to be very proactive about what you assign yourself and not always let your manager assign you work because of selection bias: the same projects and managers will always be understaffed.  
                Clients or managers might suck, and that is normal, but the work still has to get assigned.  
                A good hedge is to slightly overbook with high-quality projects so you never get the surprise “Help X with this before the deadline, please, Chris.”  
                Hit them with, “Oh, I’m already close to 90% utilization and billing, so I can pick up your project, but I’d have to tell my MD that I can’t work on his Project Y anymore,” and subtly tell your manager to reject it for you.  
                Oh, and master the art of billing clients.  
                Learn the firm’s soft rules.  
                Shape your own career and reputation within the firm on the type of work you’re decidedly good at.  
                I decided to be good at auditing developer, cloud, and platformed environments, so I tried to make a name around that.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Clients also impact how I select work.  
                Some clients might be horrible about sending documentation, while others might have special industry rules that determine their work pace: healthcare (HIPAA), fintech (PCI), government (GAS), etc.  
                I’ve noticed healthcare and government are very slow but have a ton of rules.  
                I’d avoid government clients as a personal preference.  
                If you can reverse engineer what your ideal exit role(s) would be after making senior or manager, you’d have a better idea of what you’d want to do at EY.  
                For example, I knew I wanted to do software-adjacent things, so I lobbied my managers for those types of clients.  
                Note: don’t feel discouraged if the work is boring.  
                Find other work ASAP, and never look unbusy.  
                Always fudge estimates.  
                You will get burned by your own estimates.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Oh, and you’ll only work 40+ hours if your clients suck at turning in documentation.  
                Hence, there’s always a rush near deadlines with bad clients.  
                Good clients and strict managers on those clients are green flags.  
                Personally, I like tech and found that the more complex a topic you can handle, the more you can fudge that time, bill more, and chill more.  
                (If no one else understands how cloud environments are supposed to be audited, you can take longer, bill more, and chill more.)  
                But you don’t want to be too specialized, like a “government auditor” specialist, because that is a terrible specialization.  
                Note: regions also matter for client types.  
                Houston is Oil/Gas, Dallas is CPG/Tech, Austin is Software/Alternative Brands, etc.  
                A large part of your clients will be chosen for you, so if you want to move to NY, you should probably have experience with finance stuff because my guess is that there are more clients like that there, and someone willing to take you there would want you to be able to help them with their current clients.
