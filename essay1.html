                <strong>Sand to SaaS:</strong>  
                Sand is purified and etched with light at an atomic scale. The etched pathways form chip architectures that perform logical operations. 
                Computers are chips that take input and provide an output. These input/output operations are abstracted into higher-level software. Software is built to make money.

                <strong>Double-entry bookkeeping to modern finance:</strong>  
                Tax collection is one of the oldest professions. States collect, create, manipulate, or spend money. Money can be anything people belive in. Debt and interest form the 
                backbone of growth and bubbles. Debt IOUs allow future money to be brought into and spent in the present. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. 
                Securitization derives assets into these paper IOUs and if:then statments in a standardized way for trading. Financial markets warehouse these standardized items 
                for buying and selling, providing liquidity and price discovery. 
                The name of the game was to buy low and sell high, but second level thinking requires an understanding of risk.

                <strong>Math:</strong>  
                Numeric abstraction made numeracy the single most important concept for human progress. From counting bushels of wheat in Sanskrit 
                to launching rockets into orbit, an insane amount of mathematical progress and application took place.

                <strong>Society and religion:</strong>  
                The West's classical Greek and Roman heritage, combined with the Anglo-Saxon Bible-thumping protestant work ethic society built a culture uniquely suited 
                for technological progress and institution building. Islamic and Chinese cultures technologically stagnated, while colonization diffused the West's technologies. 
                Democratic republic societies solved the historic problem of peaceful power transference, making multi-generational institution building possible. 
                Intergenerational knowledge and deep expertise is preserved (not perfectly) Hyper-specialization in a capitalistic society started at the Ford Motor line, creating 
                a plug and play infrastructure for a modern economy. 
                Modern discontent in this system arises due to stagnation and a lack of growth in the proverbial pie, leading to zero-sum thinking in policy responses.
