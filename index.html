            <p>
	    	I'm currently a Master's student at Georgia Tech studying
		Cybersecurity and Public Policy while working in risk management at Amazon.
	    <p/>

	    <p>
	    	As a reformed accountant and wannabe software engineer, I got
		into this tech/business grift after observing the perpetual
		informational asymmetry between the New York and Silicon Valley schools of thought.
		My career long thesis can be boiled down to a regulatory arbitrage play:
		The next frontier of technology products will attempt to build in the
		nonporous areas of bits, atoms, and heavy regulation, requiring tech-literate
		talent to navigate regulatory overhead when they should instead be focused
		on building. 
	    <p/>

	    <p>
	    	It shouldn't surprise you that my first job was as an IT Auditor,
		auditing the systems of development environments for compliance.
		I then did a software stint at my friend's startup (thanks, Armel).
		Check out his new robotics IoT startup, Miru, backed by YC.
		I then worked at a venture capital shop in Taipei, looking at EV
		hardware downstream to applied materials startups. 
		I wrote a paper on that Volkswagen and Continental read, pitching
		them on investing in RnD sites in Taiwan instead of Vietnam
		—don’t ask me about Sino-Western tech geopolitics; it’s a mess,
		and I could go on forever. My final stint in corporate banking at
		JPMorgan was fun, especially in 2023, where I covered risks associated
		with banking implosions plus got my first taste of finance at scale.
		Now I’m here at Amazon, doing legal and compliance stuff.
	    <p/>

	    <p>
		A little about me: Born in San Francisco, raised in Los Angeles, 
		studied accounting, infosystems, and cs at UT Austin, 
		did the banking stint in New York and the VC stint in Taipei, and currently
		work in Seattle. Love to hear
		your thoughts on technology, business, law, soft-sciences, policy, progress,
		or anything at:
