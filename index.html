            <p>
                I'm currently a Master's student at Georgia Tech studying Cybersecurity and Public Policy while working in risk management at Amazon.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a reformed accountant and wannabe software engineer, I got into this tech/business thing after observing the perpetual information 
				asymmetry between the New York and Silicon Valley schools of thought. My career-long thesis can be boiled down to a regulatory arbitrage
				play: The next frontier of technology products will build in the nonporous areas of bits, atoms, and heavy regulation, 
				requiring tech-literate business/legal talent to navigate regulatory overhead when they should instead be focused on building.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started as IT Auditor, auditing the systems of development environments for compliance. 
				I did front end engineering at a startup. I spent half a year at a VC shop in Taipei, looking at hardware/applied materials startups and
				pitched some multinational corps to build RnD centers in Taipei. 
				JPMorgan risk management was fun in 2023 when regionals were collapsing. Now Iâ€™m here at Amazon, doing legal and compliance stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fun facts: I was born in San Francisco, raised in Los Angeles, studied accounting, information systems, and computer science at UT Austin. 
				Love to hear your thoughts on technology, business, law, soft/hard sciences, policy, progress, book rec's or anything at:
