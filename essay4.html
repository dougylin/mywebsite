    Dad:
    First off all, I believe that younger generations like you don’t like put too much effort and get less reward/salary comparing yourself to a coder. This attracts people to get into this field. Secondly, there was a high bar to sit in for the CPA at 150 credit hours for Texas. This would scare some people from pursuing it unless they have passion. But anyway, I still believe the CPA license is still a life saver even AI is booming. Maybe you can pursue something like “sales strategy and operations manager” position with a license as unique strengths in tech sector.
</p>
<p>
    Me:
    I notice a lot of people who go into pure accounting are not from T20’s—accounting is like business vocational school for non-targets. No one from the Ivy-League strictly pursues accounting. The accounting grad programs simply profited off the 150 rule in certain states. A masters in Accounting or Tax doesn’t advance your career much for the price. It just helps you get licensed in a structured, less confusing, manner. Keep in mind I'm studying Accounting at UT Austin and not Cal State Northridge. The only reason why you'd pay for an accounting grad program is because you want to break into Big4.
</p>
<p>
    The iMPA and MACC programs are less valuable than the CPA license itself. These pathways exist just like pharmacy and med school because  there are a strict set of boxes you must check for entering these professions as careers.
    So consider you go to at T20 undergrad, your incentives for going into accounting are a lot lower than just doing an commercial major (CS, Econ/Finance, pre-med?) there because you’re limiting your career to only accounting—the same way someone limits their career by going to med school (not considering career switchers).
</p>
<p>
    If you ask me to show you someone who loves accounting and is good at it, I’ll point you to someone making 60k coming out of college working 90 hour weeks during filing season in B4 external audit. Accounting doesn't even lead to CFO roles, usually controller or comptroller roles. This isn't to say accounting is a bad investment if we study the returns of other career fields the same way we evaluate asset classes. The profession has a lot of more relaxed jobs in "industry" I honestly see myself settling in.
</p>
<p>
    But, think about where accounting is socioeconomically positioned as—a middle class conservative profession. There’s nothing wrong existing in the middle class 20 years ago when tech was getting destroyed in 2001 and people couldn’t find jobs in 2008. But today is different. Oxygen in the SMB, specifically medium sized enterprises, is getting thinner. Think about a barbell that’s shaped like this  |—| where you can only exist on extreme ends of the curve. That’s the current model of America. You’re either a small business servicing a niche field or a conglomerate that can take advantage of scale. Being a middle class W-2 worker right now is not worth the effort if you can roll the dice on making it to the right side of the barbell working at a BigCo (or carving out a niche on the left side like opening a small non-scaleable regional CPA shop etc which is the ceiling of accounting). Just look at how expensive health insurance today.
</p>
<p>
    I get it, companies and individuals require the CPA (to actually sign and represent clients to the IRS). So External Auditors and local CPA shops who do usually only do tax and assurance work are the only ones that exercise the ability of the CPA license. JPMorgan Internal Audit doesn’t care about the CPA (I asked and they won’t give you a bonus, nor reimburse your exam materials like Becker… and this is JPMorgan). Only EXTERNAL auditors—who now make on average 65k in 2022 working 90 hour busy seasons (because of the pyramid structure scheme in public accounting, which is unsustainable with a disinterested youth). CFO’s don’t even need the CPA. They're all ex IB folks.
</p>
<p>
    Reliance on youth to work hard and do something they don’t like makes sense when there are no jobs, no options, or if you’re a developing country (which might not even have many white collar jobs). But the way I think about accounting isn’t that we’re lazy, it’s just that we have better options only if students really knew the opportunity costs of only specializing in accounting. Audit (disguised as "Assurance") will always have low margins per engagement projects, pushing the T20+ students out of this type of industry and into more "lucrative" ones in the US.
</p>
<p>
    The way I think about the current accounting profession is like Japan. Yes, it is stable and middle class among G10, but when you consider how long they’ve stagnated as a country and how demoralized the people are there, it’s exactly like the accounting profession. Wages are stagnate and people are conservative. Even Japan’s infamously strict policy of refusing immigration is changing because they realize that they won’t survive another generation if the youth isn’t invested. Older generations in charge of policy always refuse to be proactive and not listen to the youth until their retirement pension suddenly is in danger. The narrative of the young not working hard enough makes no sense to ambitious people in Japan or accountants. There will always be a cultural ceiling for Japan the same way there are economical one's on the Accounting profession.
</p>
<p>
    My vision is this: I don’t need to be in the top 20% of accountants or tech. Just being average at both makes my skillset a specialty. The same way I know very few elite athletes are smart, or very smart people are elite athletes, the ability to play both sides is the ultimate hedge in a volatile future. Accounting is indexing 40% of my career while tech is literally my 60% tech exposure in my portfolio. Your "career skill" portfolio needs to be able to capture upside, especially in bull runs yet be able to hedge those same downturns.
</p>
<p>
    My point is this: because the future is volatile, a lot of conservative thinkers, traders, business people etc focus on mitigating the downside instead of creating a hedging strategy that adequately captures the upside in runs like the tech run the last decade. Today, I understand the importance of mitigating downside (which is why I still believe in the CPA and the profession), but not thinking about building a life strategy around capturing the unknown upsides is like asking to be like Japan. In a world that changes this fast with this many opportunities in the U.S. (with the implicit understanding of its volatility), insisting that people take only focus on a career accounting seriously is begging for the tail risk of career obsoleteness to eventually kill your career "portfolio."
