	    	    <strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>
                Why is Taiwan the only place where leading-edge nodes can be manufactured? 
                It is due to the insane amount of investment, national effort, and a culture dedicated to perfecting this craft.
                Imagine a society that values electrical engineering as the socially accepted best major to study 
                (my dad, brother, and cousins all studied EE, and I almost chose UC Davis for ECE). Now, picture your national champion (TSMC) 
                as one of the few factors stalling US-China geopolitical action, proverbially dubbed by locals as "the silicon shield."
                Now, consider that the tech stack for semiconductors, from design to manufacturing, is multiple times more 
                complex than the rocket science stack. Add the cyclical and brutal economics of operating within any part of the semiconductor stack.
                Consider the manufacturing challenge as well. Yields on die are critical for recouping investments on billion-dollar fabs that will be outdated in just a few years.
                Intel (missed mobile, GPU's, fabs) and Samsung (missed memory) have fallen behind in certain parts of the semis stack, putting them behind a couple of generations aka years. 
                Update: Intel CEO Pat G. resigned thie year and honestly I think Intel is going to be sold for parts if they can get around the CHIPS Act money restrictions.

                <strong>Why Not America?</strong>
                Software is just too lucrative. The western service sector white collar lifestyle is better than working in a fab. You 
                don't have to wear a cleansuit every 3 days a week for your 12 hour semi
                line shift looking at machines with suppressed wages due to a lack of other employers and skills transferrability. 
                Hardware talent in America is also weak (except for HW design). Immigrant talent pipelines needs to improve
                exponentially. America needs to brain drain countries that don't value their people's talents to compete with China 
                long term. Tariffs and protectionalist strategies do not make sense outside of the national defense context. Even then, 
                growth and progress is a weapon itself, which can counter the evils of degrowth and stagnation.
